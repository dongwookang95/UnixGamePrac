 Pieces are encoded as K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop, and N for knight.
 O-O (for kingside castling) and O-O-O (queenside castling).

Q1 : 
How many rounds did the game last? 
(a round is simply a pair of moves by each of the players, or the final move resulting in checkmate)

cat input.txt | fmt -w1 | grep '\.' | cut -d '.' -f 1 | wc -l

Q2 : 
How many pieces did Belle capture in this game?
cat input.txt | fmt -w1 | cut -f 1 | grep '\.' | grep 'x' | wc -l

Q3 : 
How many pieces did Belle capture with a pawn in this game?
cat input.txt | fmt -w1 | cut -f 1 | grep '\.' | grep 'x' | cut -d '.' -f 2 | grep -v '[A-Z]' | wc -l


Q4 : 
Create a table describing how many captures were made by each type of piece
(king, queen, rook, bishop or knight) in this game by Belle, not counting captures made by pawns.
The output format must be a number followed by K, Q, R, B or N to denote each type, one line per piece,
sorted in descending order, for example:
4 Q
2 B
1 R

Q5 : 
Same as Q4 except captures made by pawns must be counted as well (use P to denote pawns)

Q6 :
Which was the type of piece (K, Q, R, B, N or P) that Belle used the most?
